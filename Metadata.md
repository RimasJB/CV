These are all drafts of the original version, first written in April

These all begin with “The worst of it came three weeks in…” recounting the trip to Wal-Mart and the fear he felt.

There is no nightmare of snipers in these takes and Lisa’s brother figures prominently as a cause for their breakup and as a way to show our narrator is unreliable and doesn’t take responsibility for his actions

The end is with the bridge scene ending with 3 questions

First draft, mid April

Second draft, late April

Final draft, May
