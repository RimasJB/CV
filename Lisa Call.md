I called Lisa to let her know I’d gotten her shirts, and when she didn’t answer I sent her some texts.  Ten, in fact.  I got no response.  God forbid she’d be sick, but I checked her twitter feed and she was active.  She was intentionally ignoring me.  Her sigh when she finally answered was all I needed to know she didn’t have her happy face on.
“Sam, are we in April yet?,” she said.  
I hemmed and hawed.  “Not until next week.”
“Didn’t we agree you could call me once a month?”
“Yes, but I thought you’d want to know…”
“I don’t care what you thought I’d want to know.  What I do know is that I have my own life to live now.  And I know that my brother is still stuck in that pen for another year.”
That one dumb mistake her brother made is what ended us, and it’s a damn shame because what we had was rare and wonderful.  I know I won’t be that lucky again.  How often are people able to tell each other more in a minute without saying a word than most people could do in an hour of talking?  Or they can read each other’s moods perfectly even if one of them is across the room with their back turned?   Yes, we had our fights and we even got thrown out of a bar or two, but there was a wildness in her that I loved, and if it broke completely free from time to time I knew where to hide the knives so she couldn’t get at me with them.  Who but the most ardent of lovers ever had fights like ours?
As for her brother, he had what I’d call a twisted nerve somewhere.  It made him believe the whole planet was alive and one living thing, and all the plants and animals were really just a part of it.   The Earth spoke to them, he said, and it could speak to us if we could just remember how to listen.  This was what God wanted for us.  I told him this sounded a lot like what people eating mushrooms were saying, and that was all he needed to hear.  Right away, he got hold of a batch and it was love at first ingestion.  Now he had a mission: he was going to change the world, one batch of mushrooms at a time.  All he needed were the converts.  I suggested that if he was going to do that, he might find a way to sell the things and make some money while he was at it and his eyes lit up.  He took to it like a duck to water and made a pile of money, so much so that I believe now he was no stranger to dealing or dealers.  If he had stopped with mushrooms, he might have run into some tax trouble down the line but he certainly wouldn’t be doing hard time for it.  Instead, he got to be so in tune with everything he saw no reason why he couldn’t diversify his portfolio with some pills and other goodies.  In short, he became reckless and got busted.  Turns out talking to the Earth is not necessarily a good way to detect a narc no matter how good your hearing aid is.  That Lisa still saw this as my fault just made it clear to me she didn’t know how to reason things out.
Now, three years later, I was wondering how he was doing in that state pen.  I’d see the damn thing brooding by the highway, it’s tiny slits for eyes all but shutting it off from the outside world but not from the virus.  It was in there now and spreading through the population and no politician gave two fucks about the people in there and what would happen to them.  Regardless of his faults, Lisa loved him, and I hurted for her because I knew she hurted for him.
“So how’s Lee doing in there?”  I asked that question almost stealthily, feeling a bit like someone trying to sneak into a junkyard with a starving rottweiler guarding it.  
“I’m pretty sure he hasn’t found God’s peaceable kingdom if that’s what you mean.”
I was certain he had not.  His long-haired gospel show wouldn’t go over well in a place like that, but then again, how brutal was it for society to send a naif like that into a jail like theirs?  “I think he’s pretty quick on his feet,” is all I could manage to say.
I heard her take a few deep breaths.  “Well, you think about how he’s doing for a few weeks and call me in April like you’re supposed to.  Maybe I’ll answer.. 
So she’d have to wait two weeks to get her shirts.  So be it.  I thought back to when our love still overflowed.  I would see such flights and flutterings of things in her eyes, it was as if there was a whole world of living and wild things inside her.  It made me think her brother might be right, only the planet in question was not Earth, it was her.  But when she was getting ready to leave me, all that life I saw in her eyes had migrated off somewhere, leaving them voided and vacant.  It was as if when she looked at me, she was hoping to see something else.  
She thought the void was in me.  “Where did they go, Sam?” she said on that very last night.  “All those things I used to see when I looked at you.  You drove them off, didn’t you?”  At that point I’m thinking she must have been seeing the reflections of her eyes in mine.  “And you know how you drove them off?  Because you always need to be in control.  Control yourself. Control me. Control my brother.  They tell people to get a grip.  Anyone who knows you would tell you to do the exact opposite.”
She probably was thinking of the job I still had when I was with her.  It was a job managing people that got worse when a big firm came in and bought us out.  Then it just twisted all my sinews up into steel cables.  Being wound up is not a cliche, it is what happens to people when they get plugged into a machine that just wants to squeeze as much energy and effort out of everyone it can and then keep trying to get more.  Maybe I couldn’t hide the grip that job had on me and that’s what she saw as control.  What she probably saw was my clenched teeth.  That anyone should think I was in control of anyone or anything seemed strange to me.  Now, neither or anyone else, not even the biggest investors in the world, was in control of this virus. 
I made those walks last as long as I could because as much as I supported the lockdown and thought in my heart that most civilians could learn a lesson or two in self discipline and duty, I just wasn’t designed for this lockdown and neither was my apartment. Apart-ment.  Neither I nor the building were designed, furthermore, to withstand the pounding someone administered to the floor above my head as they did their daily afternoon aerobics.  I favored a walk down the avenue toward the city which was close enough to reach on foot if I had nothing better to do.  It was ordinarily a busy and active road, cars racing in its six lanes in packs that could be half a mile long in one direction or the other, but during the early stages of the lockdown, I could walk half a mile in the road itself and never see a car or even another person.  
Those walks were given over to brooding.  I had a list of items for brooding and I went through them, over and over.   Item one was Lisa.  She could see something changing in me and whatever it was, it was bad, but she could never quite make me understand what it was, so I got caught up in trying to work it all out myself. 
Item two was the job I had lost last year even before all this had hit.  Out of the service, I’d completed my management degree and got work managing the mechanics at a local chain of auto repair shops.  I might actually have been a bit of a control freak, but I tried to be fair and I always favored the people that worked for me.  That was okay with the original owners, but  then some bigger firm bought them out.  Soon, the new owners wanted to measure everything from how long it took Jed to remove the oil pan from an engine block - fifteen seconds;  too slow by their standards - to how much faster Roberta could get at replacing pulley belts.   They wanted me to fire them and other people I knew were doing their jobs right.   It had nothing to do with how efficient they were and everything to do with the fact they’d been loyal to that company long enough to have gotten too many raises.   I decided I wasn’t cut out to do that kind of work and that’s when one of my marine corps buddies got me a temporary job working as a bouncer.  
Lisa wasn’t thrilled with that career change, but she also wasn’t thrilled with all the crap I brought home with me from the other job.  I guess I was trying to work out how to make the money work and keep those people in their jobs and it got to gripping me all the time.  At least as a bouncer all I had to do was show up and act like I’d be willing to throw some drunk down the stairs if he grabbed some dancer’s ass.  I thought it was clever of me to take my pay under the table.  No one told me a pandemic was coming.  Now there was no place open for me to bounce people out of.
That’s where brooding item three came in.  With no money coming in and getting through to the unemployment agency well nigh impossible, I had to seriously consider the possibility I’d get tossed out of my second story abode in Paradise gardens.  The only possible fallback I had if that happened was my brother up in Buffalo who tended bar and, as far as I knew, was thinking he might need to move in with me for the same reason.   
So that’s where things stood when in the first week of April I was finally able to speak to Lisa.
