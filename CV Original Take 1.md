The worst of the fear came for me two weeks in.   I was still on the road occasionally but for no good reason.  There was always something else to get, something I’d forgotten and then I’d be done and ready to hunker down.   It was insane what I saw in that Wal-Mart - anyone who wanted to come in came in, one of the managers coughing, only half the people wearing masks.   It felt as dangerous as being point man in my platoon in Sadr City.  The virus felt like it was looking for me, hiding around every corner, its little protein fingers on its triggers, just waiting for a clean shot at some part of my throat.  I wanted, as much as possible, to not make it too easy for it, not like some of these other clowns.  I scowled at anyone getting into my space as if somehow they were in cahoots with the thing.  
I’d turn my cart into an aisle but if someone was there I just stood at the end and watched them, trying to be polite but not caring, either, if they felt a little rushed. _This is a dangerous environment to be in right now_, is what I hoped they heard me thinking.  _You don’t want to just be lollygagging around as if you have all day.  Get what you’re looking for and get the hell out of the way._
I only had a sander’s mask to wear but I knew the rules: you wear your mask for other people, they were their masks for you.  Mine would work to keep whatever I might be spewing out near me.  But so many people didn’t bother with the masks and I judged them poorly for it. They were stopping and blocking passages to have a nice little chat.  If a shopper came by wearing a mask, I gave them a thumb’s up.  Sometimes I got a silent nod back, mostly just a kind of mild stare.   When I finally got out of the store I felt as if I could finally breathe deeply again.   
I had a second cousin down in North Carolina who would take her great aunt to the Wal-mart down there just to get some stimulation.  That’s what people have to be satisfied with for entertainment if they’re poor.   My cousin said it cheered the old girl up to see all that brightly colored merchandise and to see all the people picking it up, turning it this way and that.   It was sad, really.  Now, she wouldn’t have even that and my cousin, in a way, would miss it too, would miss just the act of cheering that woman up.
I wasn’t there to get cheered up.  I was there to pick up some over the counter sleep aids, frozen pizza, some aloe vera gel and rubbing alcohol to make up batches of hand sanitizer, and, god willing, some paper towels and toilet paper.  It was amazing to me to think that you could walk into any kind of store a month ago and there would be bins full of those pocket sized hand sanitizer bottles.  Now you couldn’t get one for love or money.  It wouldn’t’ve surprised me if they became our new currency.   And, one last thing: Lisa said she was still looking for some good cotton blend tee shirts to use for masks.  I found several and stuffed them in the cart, reminding myself she’d have to boil them to make them safe.  It made me feel good to do this for her.
Back on the road there were so few cars.  The amber alert signs scolded anyone still out there: _Covid-19 Emergency.  Stay Home. Save Lives._  They wouldn’t have to tell _me_ to avoid any Wal-marts in the near future for what I saw there I was sure was going to kill people.  I called Lisa to tell her I got tee shirts for her but she didn’t answer.   Who knew what she was up to?  I was dying to tell her about the craziness I saw out there and hear her say, the way she usually did, “People are so mixed up, aren’t they?”  Other people.  Not me. 
She didn’t answer my calls that week or the next.  So I guess she’s not answering for now, I decided.  I couldn’t blame her too much for that: she had her own life to live and I’m guessing my part was no longer looking like one of the better things in it.  She was wrong about that, of course.  What we had was magical, really, and she should have known it.  As for me, I don’t think I’ll be that lucky again.  I couldn’t count the number of times we got ourselves thrown out of bars for our fighting.  Everyone knows that the more two people love each other, the harder they fight.  And Christ, she was so cute when she got mad.  In any event, I never raised a hand to her and if she got too angry I always knew where to hide the knives.  She did have a vivid imagination.  If only I _had _been getting up to all the mischief she thought I was.
I couldn’t help but wonder how she was making out in all this mess.  I also wondered if they were keeping her brother safe in that county jail.  She always blamed me for his being there and that had no doubt been a point of contention, although her calling it the last straw just showed me that at times she wasn’t capable of reasoning things out.  Sure, I told him he could probably make a lot of money selling those mushrooms,  but I sure as hell didn’t tell him to do it on Craigslist.  I told him to use the proper channels, to find a talk show host or a reality show to give him some cover.   Lisa never thought of that.  And yes, I had turned him onto the mushrooms in the first place but  he was always on about the Love of God and I thought he needed some new perspectives.  All it seemed to do was twist a few nerves even further in the God-love direction and it made him believe he could change the world and support himself and his kid to boot.  Jail wasn’t going to be a good place for his long-haired gospel show, we both knew that, but then again, how stupid and brutal was it for society to send a naif like that to a jail like theirs?  What could I do about that?  I frankly even wondered if he was still alive and what he had to do to stay that way.  The problem was that with this virus and people trapped in a place like that and no politician giving two fucks for whoever was in there, I figured it could get to be a little hairy.  Maybe Lisa was thinking the same thing and for now she just didn’t want to talk.
I supported the lockdown.  I valued discipline.   Why not let civilians experience some rough living for a change, anyway?  I, myself, tried to stay in for a day, but I and my apartment were never designed for that.  Apart-ment.  I opened the window, lay on my bed and put on my Netflix, but the card had failed on me again.  If I called they’d be asking about my employment status which was not really any of their business.  So for me,  it was whatever I could watch for free and that didn’t turn out to be better than nothing, not by a long shot.   I could watch the president come out and tell us how perfect his response was.  _ Is he trying to kill all the people in the Wal-Mart?_ I’d say.  _If so, it’s pretty perfect_.  It was time to finally do some reading and I wanted something serious for a change, maybe Clive Cussler or one of the Captain Marvel comics. But it didn’t matter which one I tried, I wound up putting it down in a minute. I just couldn’t get myself to settle down.  
Each day after that, I started to take long walks.  I’d go out of Capital Gardens and find the trail that got me to the edge of the city.  There was no one there to be seen, no cars, maybe one or two people off in the distance.   To me, it felt the way it does after one of those huge blizzards that covers all the cars and stops everyone’s life for a few days.  But this snow was invisible and it didn’t melt.  I sometimes wished someone could just take a plow and be done with it and I kept hearing the president say he was pretty much doing that, but nothing changed and nothing got better.  All that happened was that he had new people to blame every day.  I stopped watching altogether.  You can blame China all you want but we don’t live in China and they’re not going to fix anything for us.
My brother, a bartender up in Buffalo, was worried he’d be evicted, so the little chance I might be able to stay at his place was probably not in play.   I imagined I’d have to be moving on soon, also, but I figured they’d cut me some slack on the rent.  After all, who was going to take my place?  The problem for me was that no one needed a bouncer when there was no place open to bounce people out of.   I wish I’d gotten the paperwork on that job straightened out when I had the chance but I thought keeping it under the table made me pretty smart.  No one told me a pandemic was going to come.

Lisa finally answered on the fifteenth day of the lockdown.  I had taken to counting the times I called without her answering.  It was up to two twenty five and I was aiming for three hundred, so I was actually just a little disappointed when she picked up.
“Sam, that’s you right?” she said.  She didn’t have her happy face on, I could tell.  She said flatly, “are you calling for some money?”
“May I be run over by a truck if I am.”
“Okay.  Bye then.”
“No wait!”  I had to gather myself.  God-dammit I kept worrying about that girl and I didn’t know why.  But she hated it when I did that.  “I picked up some tee shirts for you.  For your masks.”
“Are you insane?  No one’s supposed to be going into a store like that right now.  You’ve been watching the news haven’t you?”
“This was two weeks ago.  It was crazy in there.  I’m glad I’m still alive.”   I heard a man’s voice and I instantly knew it must be the new husband.  I had never heard him before and I tried to picture what he would look like.  Would he be kind of a bear or would he be one of those timid types she worked with?  I thought of what was different between Lisa and I, now.   She had someone there she could look at and talk to no matter what he looked like, while I had just myself and I was getting to be unsettling company. I just needed to see another face, to hear a friendly voice.  To interact.
“How are you doing?” she asked.  That was my line.  
I wasn’t going to admit to how I felt.  “I’m doing.” I said.  “It would be great if we could do that face thing with the phones, you know?”
She paused.  I heard a child’s voice asking her for something and her saying that Daddy would go read to her and that it was his turn.  I heard the man ask who was on the phone and heard her say it’s just an old friend.  “She’s freaking out about this virus.”  I heard the man say, “Huh,” from further away.   _She’s_ freaking out?  I might’ve changed but not _that _much.  Then the sound changed and I could hear the wind and sirens where she was.  Her picture came up.   It had been three years since I’d seen that face, but now it was night and the only light was the glow from her phone.  All I saw were white lines of reflection around the edges of her face, and these white spots where her glasses reflected my image.  If I waved, I probably could see that wave. 
“I’ve been worried about you Lisa,” I said.
“Stop it.  I’m fine, there’s no reason to worry about me.  Why do you do that?”
“I know.  Why do I?  I guess it’s like something I caught.  Or something that caught me.  I just can’t seem to shake it.”   She was silent.  Then we both tried to speak at once and then we both went silent and waited for the other one to talk.  I wanted to say that I had let everything else go, that she could be with whoever she wanted to be with, and that I knew she wasn’t my wife and all that, but that the one thing that I still got stuck on, that I couldn’t quite seem to let go of, was worrying about how she was.  And it did worry me.  What if she got sick and I couldn’t be there to help her?  
“Are you alright, Sam?” she said.  “You look kind of funny.”
I tried to laugh.  “I look funny?  You should see what _you _look like.”  As soon as I said it, I could see it made her uncomfortable.  It was a little too familiar.   “Can’t you get a little light there?”
“You can see me well enough.”
“I guess.”  I waited.  “It’s so good to see a face, you know that?”  I tried to get a better look at those moving blue blocks of light and dark on the screen.  I thought I made out some worry lines but everything was out of perspective.  “Want to know something funny?” I said.  “You’ve got that phone down on the table.”
“So what if I do?”
“Well from this angle your boobs look like monuments.”
“You’re not supposed to be talking about my boobs, Sam.” She peered at something on her screen.  “Hmm.  And my head looks like it’s the size of a pea.”  She held the phone up.  “Is this better?  I won’t be able to talk long holding it up like this.”  
Now, I could see her face just a bit better.  She looked tired and worried and a little scared.  She was at least as frightened by this as I was.  
“So you’re living alone,” she said.  Good guess.
“For now.  Yes.  Alone.  It’s the strangest thing to be going through.”
“How’s your mother?” 
I hadn’t been to the nursing home now for two months.  “She’s still at Living Active.”
“Are they keeping her safe there?”
_Why wouldn’t she be safe in a goddam nursing home_, I thought.  What place could be more safe?
“What does she think?”  
“She just wants to get the hell out of there, in general, virus or no virus.  She says there’s nothing but old people in there.  But what can I do?  She’s up in Buffalo and I’m down here.”  I wanted to change the subject.  “When can I bring you the tee shirts?”
“Did I ask you to get me tee shirts, Sam?  When did I do that?”
“Well you told me three weeks ago you were looking…”
“That’s not the same as asking you to go and get me some stupid tee shirts.”  Her voice was rising now, just like old times.  I remember how it felt when she used to nag me.  I would get annoyed and impatient but there was something else there also.  There were all these parts of me that leaned toward her voice, even if she was nagging at me,  the way weeds leaned toward the sun.  And those weeds didn’t care if they were growing in some rubble strewn lot in a war zone, for if the sun was there, and they had a bit of water, the world was a good place.  If only I could see her face more clearly.  I wanted her to keep talking to me because I needed just a little bit more of that sound to keep me going. But what to say?
“Are you afraid at all?” I said.  It felt forced, but all conversation now felt odd to me.  Talking to people was becoming an unusual thing.
“Aren’t you?”
“Damn right I am.”  Even a tough old Marine could admit it. “I didn’t think I would be, but I do see the news.”  I thought of the horrific images, the people face down on gurneys struggling just to breathe.  “You don’t want to get on one of those tubes.”
“You’re right about that,” she said. “You get on one of those, you stay on until they move you to the truck.”  She giggled.  “I guess that’s not funny.”  
“Well, it _is _kind of funny.  Great news, Mrs. Jones, we’ve moved your husband out of the ICU and into our temporary outside housing.  It’s refrigerated!”   We both laughed and maybe we both felt a little weird for laughing at it.
Beyond her balcony there was the firecracking roar of a loud motorcycle cutting against the silence and she turned for a moment toward it.  Outside mine, there were three men in tank tops leaning on the back of a pickup, smoking cigarettes and speaking Spanish.  I saw the squat silhouette of a mujer in the opposite doorway keeping silent watch.  I didn’t know how to say, “Where are your masks?” in Spanish and I guess that was a good thing.
“Sam,” she said.  “Why haven’t you found someone already?”
I wanted to say I thought I had, but I knew that would not do right then.  What was the right response?  “I’m not trying to get you back, Lisa.  That’s not why I called.  Geez. If I find someone, I find someone.  I have nothing against the idea.”
“Haven’t you tried the online thing?”
I wanted to laugh.  “Now?  In this mess?  Anyway, you’re pretty much the only person I can call right now.”  I knew this would upset her so I jumped in hard with more.  “But don’t worry, it’s not going to stay that way.  It’s just that now.”  Where was I going with this?  I didn’t want her to do what she always did and find a way to end the call.  “I’m just a little off balance.”
“Sure you are.  We all are.  We’ll survive.”
“Or not.” 
“Or not.  Maybe you should call that therapist again.”
“It just makes me feel worse to think I have to pay someone to talk to me.”   Was it really the tubes that frightened me or was it something I could already feel moving loose inside me somewhere?
There was an owl hooting somewhere in the development.  I’d never heard it before but now, with the traffic on Tremaine Avenue almost completely gone, it was there.  It had been, all along.  It felt like a small miracle, like one of those life-after-people shows, and my mood suddenly became oddly hopeful.  It was as if some magician had just dragged a scarf over everything I was afraid of and it had all turned into nothing but a bunny.  For just a moment, I even forgot I was talking to her.  I saw her shadowy face looking at me as if waiting for something.  “I’m going to volunteer and I’ll be out and about again,” I said, out of nowhere. It was a straight-up lie, but hearing myself say it, it sounded like something I might try.
“That’s a good idea, Sam.”  I could hear how tired she was.  
So I was not the only one exhausted by this.  I knew this talk was just about over, but I still needed a bit more, something to remind me I was not just a flickering image on someone’s screen.  That way, I could easily get through another few days.  “I’m glad you answered, Leece.  I think I just needed to see a friendly face.”
“And mine is a friendly face.” She laughed softly.  I heard more sounds coming from inside her apartment.  “You have no idea how messed up I look.  And maybe you shouldn’t be so sorry for yourself.  We’re all driving each other up the wall here.”
So the choice was either to be in solitary and go crazy that way,  or to be trapped in a room with other people making you crazy.  I could hear a hint in her voice that told me how she knew she had it much better than me, although I couldn’t call it pity, she was better than that. It was a new kind of difference in our lives and we both felt it.  I was one of the people stranded alone on an island, while she had other people on hers.  It didn’t matter if it was just one or two other people, but it was almost as if we inhabited different realities just because of that one fact of our lives.  She sighed.  “Well, Sam, I’ve got to go.”
I was just about to ask when I could call again when the image vanished.  I looked at the time on the display:  it was only nine and I was alone with the night and all its hours.  As for Lisa, I knew she wouldn’t be picking up again any time soon.  What to do with myself now?  I decided on a walk.  I was so confused by everything it took me the better part of an hour just to find my keys and my hand sanitizer mix.  And, of course, I had to fashion a mask.   I watched a video five times until I thought I had it.  The woman in the mask video looked so happy, as if cutting a mask to protect yourself from a killer virus was the happiest thing she could think of doing just then.  It seemed that when she put hers on it was all she could do to keep from laughing.  I made one that was ugly, but more than adequate for the purposes.  I wasn’t, after all, planning to crash the local hospital and go dive into the used gown bin.  
Out on Tremaine avenue, I noticed a bus coming.   It looked empty and so, on the spur of the moment,  I jogged over to the stop to take it.  The bus driver opened the front door but held his hand out to stop me getting on.  He pointed to the rear.  “Get on in the back,” he said.  “The ride is free.”  All I could see were his eyes above his surgical mask, but in them was the same look I had seen in Lisa’s eyes: fear, fatigue, and wariness..  
I was not alone on the bus.  There was one man, clearly homeless, with a large suitcase full of whatever it was he owned in this life, sprawled out on one of the sideways facing benches, one arm leaning against his fold up walker.  Another man sat quietly near the middle door, his skin a kind of light brown with a sheen of gray over it as if an angel of death wasn’t sure whether or not he had the right mark on his door so it was going to stick around for a bit.   I tried to sit as far forward as I could before I hit the taped off area ten feet behind the driver.  I took out my sanitizer and wiped my hands and somehow this caused the grey-skin guy to startle awake and make a kind of chortling, snorting sound.  He looked briefly panicked, as if he had missed his stop, then settled into a stare.  As soon as we hit the city limits I was off the bus.  I wondered how that guy with the walker managed that suitcase of his.  Maybe he had some stories to tell.   Maybe another time, I thought, when it would be more safe for people to talk again.
I walked for a few minutes in the street itself and had made it almost to the crest of the first hill in the city, when a woman appeared over its edge, heading toward me.  She was an elegant woman with long, luxuriant dark hair, and an aristocratic face.  She wore only a slip and pearls.  She held a single high-heeled shoe in one hand, while with the other, she was trying to get the other shoe off even as she skipped and ran ahead.  I raised my hand to get her attention, but she ran past as if she couldn’t even see me.   A man who looked to be in his early forties came jogging breathlessly up the hill, clearly after her.  He could’ve been her husband - he was certainly of her class - but then again, he could be anything else.  He looked vaguely familiar, like a celebrity whose name was now escaping me.  He wore an impatient, rather than angry, look.  He waved to me as he went past and said, “She gets like this sometimes.”
“During a plague you mean?”  I said.  I heard her shouting at him when he finally caught her.  “Get your hands off me...honey you don’t understand...stay away, you’re a horrible person...look I didn’t mean to say it, I didn’t mean it….”   I’d never had a conversation like that with a woman wearing pearls in the middle of a deserted street myself and I didn’t mean to intrude on theirs, so I moved on and down over the hill.  Life on the empty avenue was beginning to resemble an arcade ride through a long dark tunnel.   
I had gone another three blocks before a police car appeared.  It pulled over and the officer inside asked me what I was doing.  “You might want to go a bit further up the street,” I said, pointing.  “I think there’s some trouble up there.”
“That’s not what I asked you.  What is your business out here?”
“I was driving my wife crazy,” I decided.  “I had to get out of her way.  I’m not going anywhere in particular.”  
“How about I give you a ride home?” 
“Is it safe?  How do I know you’re not infected?”
“How do I know _you’re _not infected? I’m not scared.  I’ve got a mask and so do you.”
“Officer, I really don’t need a ride.”
“It don’t bother me.  It’s driving me crazy being out here with no people around.”
I understood.  The slogan I kept hearing was that we were alone together and it was true.   The problem was it was making us mighty uncomfortable.  I got in just as a city sanitation truck came slowly whining up the hill.  Could it be that late already?  Where had the time gone?   And where to go now?  Certainly not home.  Then it occured to me.  I could go to Lisa’s place.   I wouldn’t go in, of course,  but I’d be near her.   Perhaps I could feel that she was safe if I could just listen for coughing.  
I knew which block she lived on and that was close enough. Lisa lived in an enclave that was just across a boulevard from one of the city’s poorest wards.   Now, as we drove through that ward,  all of the lights in all the houses were dark and, since there were so few streetlights,  it seemed  that the neighborhood and it’s small, ramshackle homes only came into being by the grace of the car’s headlights, almost as if the car was temporarily painting them and the lives inside them into existence.  It was an eerie and ghostly feeling and the cop and I were dead silent as one house after another emerged and disappeared again.  Then, the radio squawked and on it was a woman’s speaking only in numbers and letters.  All I could tell was there was something happening near the river.
The cop said, “We’ve got a report of a possible sick person.  I’ve got to bring him in right now.  You want to come along, I can drop you off at your house later.”  
I had no interest in being in any car with a sick person.   “I’ll just get out here.”
The cop looked around.  “You sure?  Not too many people your color around here.”
“I’m fine.  My wife’s black.  I’m cool.  Her uncle lives around here.”  It was my night of outrageous lying and I wondered if this wasn’t one of the early symptoms of the virus.  “Are you sure you need to pick that guy up?”
“Do you think I want to?”  There were the same lines of fear in his face I saw, however dimly, in Lisa’s.  He stopped the car and I got out.
It was getting to be chilly now and I needed to keep moving, either on to Lisa’s place or back home.  I went through the pros and cons of continuing on to Lisa’s place.  It would already be morning by the time I got there and I had been on that bus and in that squad car.  For all I knew, I had particles all over my clothes and I’d be doing no one any favors with any visit.  Besides, I hadn’t brought the tee shirts.   Finally, there was the high probability of her getting a restraining order out on me if I showed up unannounced. 
So I headed back toward Tremaine.  Like any other day of the plague, the normal rules of progress and accomplishment didn’t seem to be operating.  I was moving through a time in which the normal relations of things to each other had changed and, although I could hear things ripping apart, I couldn’t see what they were.  All I knew was that things were now moving at different speeds than they usually did, some faster, some slower, and some things not moving at all.   I began to reconsider my situation with Lisa:  why did I have to bother her, after all?  All I could do now, at best, was add confusion.  If anything was ever to happen with her again,  that time wasn’t now and we’d both be different people then in that future if it ever came.
My eyes adjusted to the darkness as I moved under the trees lining the street, past the chain link fences and the homes and squat brick buildings of the poor and on toward the park.  I heard someone coughing and when a light went on in that person’s house it blinded me for a moment.  That bus driver might live in a place like that, I thought.  I hoped he and his family were as safe as they could be, but how safe was that?  A frustration I could not quite name boiled inside me.
When I crossed the bridge over the creek I was suspended high above what was not a silent space, but a space in which the normal sounds of human machinery were absent.  Instead, there were the sounds of the creek and the hooting calls of nocturnal birds and the occasional songs and whistles of so many others.  There was a heavy flapping of wings and then a fluttering answer of many smaller ones, like they were playing some sort of music whose rules were worked out by long dead ancestors.  I heard animal sounds I did not know or recognize and I remembered reading of coyotes and bobcats seen in the streets.  I thought I saw large shadows moving through the lights of the parkway below and imagined bears and cougars meandering slowly through the deserted spaces, their paws gently landing on and reading the cool asphalt for signs known only to them.  Would they also feel that something was different, that something had changed?  Would they, in their own way, feel vindicated in their effortless and natural reverence for the gods of the forests and the streams?  Would they now have reason to feel that the world had become, at least for them, more safe and sane?
